If the stress on an object is larger than a limit decided by the material properties, the object will not only deform, it will also break. If a fracture is to take place it has to be determined where to break the structure. The method used to determine how the elements break is presented in [?].

This method uses the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor $\sigma$ to create
