\subsubsection{Main functionality}
The \texttt{Solver} class contains the functionality for finding a solution to the dynamic system. The strain matrices are found for all elements, and are then used to construct the elementwise stiffness matrices. These are then assembled into a global stiffness matrix, which is used to calculate the displacements of all the nodes in the system.
